Example came from here: http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/769084/Observer-Pattern-Csharp

## Description

 In actual terms in the observer pattern - "There are n numbers of observers (objects) which are interested in a special object (called the subject). 
 Explaining one step further- there are various objects (called observers) which are interested in things going on with a special object (called the subject). 
 So they register (or subscribe) themselves to subject (also called publisher). The observers are interested in happening of an event (this event usually happens in the boundary of subject object) whenever this event is raised (by the subject/publisher) the observers are notified.
