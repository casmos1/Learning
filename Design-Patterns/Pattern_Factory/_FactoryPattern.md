# Factory Pattern

Example came from here: http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/designpatterns/FUcV280513-Factory-Method-Design-Pattern---C

## Description

In Factory pattern, we create an object without exposing the creation logic. In this pattern, an interface is used for creating an object, but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate. 
The creation of the object is done when it is required. The Factory method allows a class later instantiation to subclasses.
